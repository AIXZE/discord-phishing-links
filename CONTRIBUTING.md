# Contributing

Below are some general rules & guidelines to keep in mind before and while contributing : 

1. Are your submitted links already in the [list](https://github.com/nikolaischunk/discord-phishing-links/blob/main/domain-list.json)? Please do check against all of your submitted links beforehand to avoid duplicates!
2. Are your submitted links **Discord** phishing links? This is a repository focused on gathering [Discord](https://discord.com) phishing links, so please only submit relevant links!
3. **[Optional]** Are you putting your submissions in such that they're alphabetized in the overall list? While not a requirement, it's helpful to leave the alphabetization intact.
