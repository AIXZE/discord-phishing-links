# Contributing

Below are some general rules & guidelines to keep in mind before and while contributing:

1. Are your submitted links already in the [list](https://github.com/nikolaischunk/discord-phishing-links/blob/main/domain-list.json)? Please do check against all of your submitted links beforehand to avoid duplicates!
1. Are your submitted links **Discord** phishing links? This is a repository focused on gathering Discord phishing links, so please only submit relevant links!
1. [`Optional`] Are you putting your submissions in such that they're alphabetized in the overall list? While not a requirement, it's helpful to leave the alphabetization intact.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Project!
